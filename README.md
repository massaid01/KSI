# Clustering in KSI Dataset

This is my first project in unsupervised machine learning with the dataset from the official police Toronto 
The dataset can be checked here : https://data.torontopolice.on.ca/datasets/TorontoPS::ksi/explore?location=43.722757%2C-79.382143%2C11.43

The project aims to categorize the areas where collision cases occur and gain insight into the data set from 2004 - 2020
